Perfect! I've created a beautiful HTML/JavaScript website monitoring dashboard that provides all the functionality of the Python script. Here are the key features:
üåü Features:
Visual Dashboard

Beautiful, modern UI with gradient backgrounds
Real-time status cards for each website
Color-coded status indicators (green for online, red for offline)
Responsive design that works on mobile and desktop

Monitoring Capabilities

Single Check: Check all websites once
Continuous Monitoring: Auto-check at set intervals (30s to 30min)
Real-time Updates: Live status updates without page refresh
Status Summary: Shows total, online, and offline counts

Customizable Settings

URL Management: Add/remove URLs directly in the textarea
Flexible Intervals: Choose from 30 seconds to 30 minutes
Easy Controls: Start/stop monitoring with simple buttons

Detailed Information

Response times for each website
Last check timestamps
Error messages for offline sites
Check counter and history

üöÄ How to Use:

Save the HTML file (e.g., website-monitor.html)
Open in your browser
Add your URLs in the textarea (one per line)
Choose check interval from the dropdown
Click "Check Once" for immediate check or "Start Monitoring" for continuous monitoring

üìù Default URLs Included:
http://apps.benwinindonesia.com
https://qrcode.sobatam.com
https://sobatam.com/analytics
‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes:
CORS Limitations: Since this runs in a browser, there are some limitations due to CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) policies:

Some websites may not allow cross-origin requests
The script tries multiple methods to check website availability
Results may show "Unknown (CORS)" for status codes

üîß Advanced Features:

Auto-refresh: Automatically updates every few seconds during monitoring
Error Handling: Graceful handling of network errors and timeouts
Mobile Responsive: Works perfectly on phones and tablets
No External Dependencies: Pure HTML/CSS/JavaScript - no libraries needed

üí° Usage Tips:

For best results: Run this on a local server or deploy to avoid CORS issues
Testing: Use the "Check Once" button to test your URLs first
Monitoring: Start with a longer interval (5+ minutes) to avoid overwhelming servers
URLs: Include the full URL with http:// or https://

The dashboard will show real-time status updates, response times, and maintain a running count of online/offline websites. It's perfect for monitoring your website portfolio!
